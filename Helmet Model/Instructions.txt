I think that you will need some help with the programming.
It's easy, but at least you will need some basics knowledge
Here I will describe you the fields that you need to modify to change the animations.
-line 49: #define MAXANIMATIONS 14 (Change the number to the max animations you have programmed)
-line 309: For each animation you will must to add a "case" sentence with the fields that you need.
maxframes(number of frames of the animation)
DISPDELAY(how fast the animation will change the frame to next one, 0 is faster it can)
framestart(All animations are saved in "myfont.h", Here you must to write in what frame start. Example: the first animations will start in the frame number 0, the next one will start in the frame number 0+the number of frames of the last animation, the third one will start in the 0+number of frames of the second one+number of frames of third one)
loops:(number of times the animation will be show each time is randomly choose)
typeanimation:(1 for animations, 0 for text)
in case you have a text animation you will must to add a couple of variables:
msg("message you want to show)
Background(1 or 0, it will invert the colors of the letters/background)
In the myfont.h archive you will write the code for your animations you will must to change:
-line 1:myfont[245][32](the first number must to be the max number of frames that you have, the second one is the size of your screen, in our case 32)
then the code that you can see has been generated with one application that I attached you to the mail. The code generate is not exactly in the same format, so try to keep it)
I think that with that information you will have enough. In my opinion you will must start making some small changes.
